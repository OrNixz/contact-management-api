## Description üìñ
Designed for simplicity, this API, which I learned about by watching tutorials on YouTube, enables managing contacts and their related addresses. It grants users the ability to perform basic CRUD operations on both contacts and addresses while ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.

## Features ‚ú®
- User registration, login, and logout
- Create, read, update, and delete contacts
- Create, read, update, and delete addresses for each contact
- Search contacts by name, email, and phone number
- Pagination support for contact search results

## Prerequisites System ‚öôÔ∏è
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MySQL database (or any other database supported by Prisma)

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Prisma (ORM)
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- Joi (for input validation)
- uuid (for generating unique identifiers)
- Winston (for logging)
- Jest (for testing)
